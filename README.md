# Electron AI Code Packer

**Electron AI Code Packer** is an Electron-based AI-powered code repository analyzer and packer. It provides an intuitive interface for analyzing, processing, and packaging code repositories into AI-friendly formats with advanced features like code minification and detailed repository statistics.

## ‚ú® Key Highlights

- üìÇ **Repository Scanning**: Scans repositories to identify files, apply filters, and generate a directory structure.
- üõ†Ô∏è **File Processing**: Supports options like removing comments, removing empty lines, and performing security checks to sanitize files.
- üìú **Output Formatting**: Formats processed repositories for various LLMs, including ChatGPT, Claude, and others.
- üñ•Ô∏è **User-Friendly Interface**: Provides an intuitive UI for selecting repositories, configuring options, and viewing/saving output.
- üîç **Customizable Options**: Allows users to set file size limits, exclude patterns, and add custom headers for output files.

## üöÄ Quick Start

Get up and running in minutes:
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/amafjarkasi/electron-ai-code-packer.git
git clone https://github.com/amafjarkasi/electron-ai-packer.git

# Install dependencies
cd electron-ai-code-packer
npm install

# Start the application
npm start
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Core Features

### Repository Scanning
- Identifies files in the repository while respecting `.gitignore` and user-defined exclusion patterns.
- Generates a structured directory tree:
  - Sorted with directories first, then files
  - Automatically excludes common build directories
  - Maintains relative paths for better context
- Provides detailed repository statistics:
  - File counts by type and size
  - List of largest files for optimization
  - Skipped files tracking based on filters
  - Size statistics in human-readable format
  - Extension-based file categorization

### File Processing
- Removes comments and empty lines from code files.
- Performs security checks to redact sensitive information like API keys and private keys.
- Supports token counting for AI model compatibility.
- Minifies code with advanced optimizations:
  - JavaScript/TypeScript minification with Terser
  - CSS optimization with property merging and advanced restructuring
  - HTML compression with attribute optimization and whitespace removal

### Output Formatting
- Formats processed files for different LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Gemini).
- Includes options for adding custom headers and repository descriptions.

### User Interface
- Simple navigation with tabs for repository selection, options configuration, and output viewing.
- Real-time progress updates during processing.
- Options to copy output to the clipboard or save it to a file.

## Configuration

### Processing Options
- **Max File Size**: Set maximum file size to process (default: 10MB).
- **Exclude Patterns**: List of file patterns to exclude.
- **Remove Comments**: Strip comments from processed code.
- **Security Checks**: Enable security vulnerability scanning.
- **Custom Header**: Add custom documentation header.
- **Code Minification**:
  - JavaScript/TypeScript: Compress and optimize code
  - CSS: Advanced optimization with property merging
  - HTML: Whitespace and attribute optimization

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
**Slow Processing:**
- Reduce max file size.
- Exclude large binary files.
- Close other resource-intensive applications.

**Application Crashes:**
- Ensure you have the latest version.
- Check system requirements.
- Verify sufficient disk space.
